My name is Jacob and I'm a lover of the code, I like science, hacking, physics, games, music, so on. I have about 12 years of experience working with technologies and creating systems for big companies. I enjoy being a developer and facing new challenges.

I have currently build projects using:

- Kotlin
- Java
- Python

As well I know a variety of tools and technologies, I am not limited to new challenges and I love to learn new things.
