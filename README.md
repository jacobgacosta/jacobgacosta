I'm a software developer for over 11 years now and I love the code, science and technology I believe in a better world
and I think technology can help in the process.

I have currently build projects using:

- Kotlin
- Java
- Python
- Php
- Javascript

As well as a variety of tools and technologies underlying the above, I am not limited to new technologies and I love learning new things.
